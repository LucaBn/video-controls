## Where can i use it?
1. [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org/)
2. [Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/) (not 100% of times, it depends on the player used for the specific video)
3. [Tumblr.com](https://www.tumblr.com/) (it's partially overlapped by Tumblr video player but let's say it works)
4. [9gag.com](https://9gag.com/)
